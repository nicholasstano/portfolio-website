                <p>Hello!  I'm Nick, a Full Stack Developer living in New York City having completed Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Program.  During my time I explored in how fantasy sports drafts happen, how sports sites keep track of and update their page with results at all points of the day, how meetup applications are created and I made it a goal to create my own projects to understand the how behind this.
                </p>
                <p>I have been working with
